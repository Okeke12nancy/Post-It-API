## Usage

- Clone the repo
- cd into the directory such that you are in `Post-It API`.
- Create a project on mongodb and copy your MONGODB_URI
- Create a .env file at the root of the folder and include the following

```
- PORT
- MONGODB_URI
- NODE_ENV
- EMAIL_TEST
- EMAIL_TEST_PSWO
- EMAIL_TEST_APP_PSWD
- JWT_SECRET
- CLOUD_NAME
- API_KEY
- API_SECRET
- BASE_URL

```

- To run the solution, make sure you have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

- Use the following command in your terminal to initialize the applicationa and to install the necessary dependencies.

```
npm init -y
npm install
npm run dev or npm start
```

# Testing

- For Api testing:
  - POSTMAN
  - Thunder Client
  - REST Client

**note**

- Make sure to specify the url, token and id correctly when making requests
